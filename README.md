# Perceptron and Adaline Neurons Implementation in Python

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of the perceptron and adaline neuron for solving the XOR problem in Python. The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of how neural networks work and how to implement them from scratch. I implemented both first order and second order versions of each neuron, and the project includes Jupyter Notebook files with the code.

This project was completed as part of the "Neural Networks" (changed to "Neural Computing and Deep Learning") course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran, taught by Professor Reza Safabakhsh(<safa@aut.ac.ir>). I took this course during my Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering at AUT in Spring 2022.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was generated specifically for the XOR problem, but other datasets can be applied as well. The details of the dataset can be found in the Jupyter Notebook files.
